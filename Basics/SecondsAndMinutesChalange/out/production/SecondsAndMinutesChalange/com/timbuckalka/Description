Create am method called getDurationString with two parameters,
first parameter minutes and 2nd parameter seconds.

You should validate that the 1st parameter minutes is >= 0.
You should validate that the 2nd parameter seconds is >= 0 and <=59.
the method should return "Invalid Value" in the method if either of the above are not true.

If the parameters are valid then calculate how many hours, minutes and
seconds equal the minutes and seconds passed to this
method and return that value as string in format "XXh YYm ZZs".

Create a 2nd method of the same name but with only one parameter seconds.

Validate that it is >=0, and return "Invalid value" if it is not true.

If it is valid, calculate how many minutes are in the seconds value and the call
the other overloaded method passing the correct minutes and seconds calculated so
that it can calculate correctly.

Call both methods to print values to the console.
